  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Current resident of Portland, Or. Originally hailing from the windy city of Chicago, I moved to the pacific northwest nearly a decade ago in search of a more relaxed atmosphere and temperate weather (anyone who has spent significant time in the midwest can sympathize with me). I'm an outgoing, dynamic problem solver who thrives in a diverse social and professional atmosphere.</p>

  <h2>Why I Began my Coding Journey...</h2>
  <p>After a 15 year career in the service and hospitality industry, I found myself both physically and mentally exhausted. The covid-19 pandemic had left me and many other people both jobless and searching for direction, so I knew it was time for a <strong>big</strong> change. I have always loved problem solving, and was looking for something that would finally exercise my brain again after many years of exhausting physical labor, dealing with ungrateful customers, and menial tasking. Epicodus has provided me just that opportunity. For the first time in a long time, I am facing daily challenges that are <em>actually</em> engaging, and truly enjoying problem solving with my fellow students in the pair programming. I am so grateful to have this opportunity, and am looking forward to a bright future in the tech industry!</p>
