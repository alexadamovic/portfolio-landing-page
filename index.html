    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Originally hailing from the bustling city of Chicago, I moved to the pacific northwest nearly a decade ago in search of a more relaxed atmosphere and temperate weather (anyone who has spent significant time in the midwest can sympathize). I've been living in Portland, Oregon ever since then and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The food is outstanding, the people are friendly and laid-back, the beer is world-class, and the easy access to nature simply can't be beat!</p>

    <h2>Why I Began my Coding Journey...</h2>
    <p>After a 15 year career in the service and hospitality industry, I found myself at a crossroads. I had lost my job due to the covid-19 pandemic, as so many others did, and found myself feeling lost and helpless. I knew it was time for a <strong>big</strong> change. I've always loved problem solving, and was looking to find something that would finally help me to exercise my brain again after many years of exhausting physical labor, ungrateful customers, disgruntled co-workers, and menial tasks.</p>
    <p>Epicodus has provided me with exactly the opportunity I was looking for. For the first time in a long time, I'm facing daily challenges that are <em>actually</em> engaging. I'm truly enjoying problem solving with my fellow students in the pair programming model, and working with a new partner every day gives me access to a wealth of knowledge and experience that my classmates possess. I'm beyond grateful to have this opportunity, and am looking forward to a bright future in the tech industry!</p>
    
    <h2>Current and Past Projects</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/alexadamovic/clown-blog" target="_blank">Clown Blog</a></h3>
    <p>An unfinished satirical blog about how much I don't like clowns. Straight up not very good, but at least I tried...</p>
    <h5>HTML / CSS</h5>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/alexadamovic/otters-are-cool" target="_blank">An Informative Page About Otters</a></h3>
    <p>Pretty much exactly what it says it is. Some info is real and some is made up. Can you tell the difference???</p>
    <h5>HTML / CSS</h5>
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/alexadamovic/Animal-Shelter" target="_blank">Lil Bitey's Animal Shelter</a></h3>
    <p>A webpage I made for a local animal shelter. It's not real. One day these examples will be replaced with actually decent portfolio work. Today is not that day.</p>
