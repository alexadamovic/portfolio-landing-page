  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>Current resident of Portland, Or. Originally hailing from the windy city of Chicago, I moved to the pacific northwest nearly a decade ago in search of a more relaxed atmosphere and temperate weather (anyone who has spent significant time in the midwest can sympathize with me). I'm an outgoing, dynamic problem solver who thrives in a diverse social and professional atmosphere.</p>
